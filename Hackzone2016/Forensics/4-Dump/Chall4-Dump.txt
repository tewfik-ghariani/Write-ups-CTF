1) This is a memory dump, you must understand that you'll be using volatility !

2) First step is to find out the operation system that was running on the computer from which we got the memory dump!

volatility -f Dump.raw imageinfo

=>> Win2008R2SP1x64



3) First reflex is to check the list of process which were running! 

volatility -f Dump.raw pslist --profile=Win2008R2SP1x64

4) Obviously, the process 'flag.'  will catch your eyes !

5) Execute this !

 volatility -f  Dump.raw  --profile=Win2008R2SP1x64 procexedump -p 1804 --dump-dir .


6) execute it or simply use string 

===> The Flag Is Th4nks_f0r_c0m1ng



See you next year !
