###### Hint :
Find the gold!!

1) This appears to be a damaged disk as well, but this challenge is very tricky as it seems that testdisk isn't enough to recover its content...

2) We'll start by using the recovery tool 'testdisk' , we'll come across a lot of files all talking about the movie 'Baby's day out'

3) After searching through all of them.. Nothing! 
The hardest part of this challenge is to think outside the box.. and not to limit yourself to testdisk.... Using [photorec](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec) might help you capture the flag!


4) Using photorec, you'll be able to recover a few files that were deleted and not saved in the system file index !
Keeping in mind the hint ' Find the gold ', you'll find a picture of 'A Golden Book' !

5) Study its meta-data using exiftool to find
